* according to [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interpolate](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interpolate) -  During the course of processing some data, and in response to a directive in that data, to fetch data from a different source and process it in-line along with the original data.
	* If you define a variable `monkey` that's equal to the string `"Curious George"`, and then you have a string that says `"I took #{monkey} to the zoo"`, Ruby will do something called **string interpolation** and replace the `#{monkey}` bit with the value of `monkey`—that is, it will print `"I took Curious George to the zoo"`.
